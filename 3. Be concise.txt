# Be concise

When presenting something, people often try to show so many things at once. They do not want people to miss anything, afraid people will go away before seeing everything.

But when shown so many things at the same time, people will get overwhelmed, and the most important information will be lost between distracting information, that’s supposed to be a complement.

Many studies say that it’s better to be concise. Focus on the main idea first, and then you can elaborate on what that means. We can create a certain flow to slowly give the details.

Although it’s undeniably hard to choose the right words to convey what you mean without too many complexities and to still have a soul in it, not just like a manual book with instructions.

Even while writing this blog, I still have to practice a lot on how to write concisely, but at the same time, to create something interesting to read enough until the end.
