# Sharing Ideas

I love it when I find a new blog, website, or Youtube channels that can give me new knowledge or perspectives and how it can make me curious about topics I never even think about before. That inspired and gave me the excitement to challenge myself what if I make one also. Since then, I’ve always been interested to share my ideas and thoughts with people, but I’ve always held myself for endless reasons.

Then I found a lot of great people that have the courage to just share about their experiences, what they know, and what they believe in, in their own way, like [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/) through his blog and [Valen](https://youtu.be/Abruba8pu_Q) through her videos. They inspired me to just start, see where this takes me, and enjoy the process itself. 

Now I try to always remind myself that it’s important to just start when I want to do something, and try to do better along the way, rather than waiting for myself to be “good enough”. As we grow, the idea of what is “good enough” also grows and it’s a never-ending process. 

I hope that this blog can be useful for someone, or maybe trigger a new discussion about the topics that I talk about here, or anything related to it. Also, at the same time, to encourage everyone that has been holding themselves to create what they always wanted, to just do it. As it’s always better to start doing it, no matter how small, no matter how bad, you’re getting closer to your goals.
