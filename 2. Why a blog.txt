# Why a blog

In times like now, when everything is fast-paced, and everything in our life is depended on certain platforms, I want to be able to share what I think, without having to worry about what if the algorithm changes, what if the app interface changes, or even what if people simply don’t use the platform anymore.

Although I know that no system is fail-proof, and change is the only constant thing, but in a website or blog, I have more control over my content, and how it’s presented, and people can always access it easily as long as they have an internet connection and access to a web browser, which most people do right now, without the fuss of having to download the app first, or registering an account.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t condemn how platforms and most apps work. But I believe when something is made available on an app, or having to register an account first, is one needs the perks of what mobile-apps can do, and how certain things can be linked with your personal details for a seamless experience.

I want to share in a place that is easy to be found and accessed, and where people can read at their own pace. So far, I find that a blog is the best alternative.
