# Keep it simple

When creating something, sometimes we tend to make things way more too complicated than how they should be. Sometimes we try so hard to give our best, we ended up stepping too far and forget the most important part, it must be understood by other people.

If we have a great idea, but we put too many confusing details or making it too complicated, people usually find it difficult to be able to relate and understand the idea.

Then the question is, how do we make sure that we’re not going too far. One of the few things that a lot of people find effective is by putting the ideas into words and read them aloud. If it’s too complicated, usually you can tell when reading it. If you didn’t find any problem when doing it, try sharing it with a friend. If it’s too complicated, you might be finding difficulties sharing it with them by also make sure that they understand it the way you want it. Last but not least, the following questions and responses can show you is it still too complicated or not.

It is also important that if the responses show that it’s too complicated or cannot be understood, maybe it’s just because you didn’t explain it well, not because the whole idea is bad. Try not to do any denial when the responses are not as good as expected. Those responses are often the most important ones.

When creating something, it is important to create something that can be understood by people. We can’t solve a problem with a solution that people can’t even understand.
